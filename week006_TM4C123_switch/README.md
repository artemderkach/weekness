Objectives: Design a security system with two sensors and one alarm. Contact switches will be used for the sensors. If the window is secure the switch will be pressed, and if the window is open, the switch will be released. The alarm condition will be a flashing LED. The system can be activated/deactivated with a toggle switch.
